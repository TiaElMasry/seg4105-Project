# PITCH 
<Strong>Problem: </Strong>
<br>
The problem we're addressing is the increasing demand for food delivery services, coupled with the desire for high-quality, chef-prepared meals. Current food delivery platforms like Uber Eats offer a wide range of options, but the quality and consistency of the food can be hit or miss. Customers often want the convenience of delivery without sacrificing the quality of a restaurant dining experience. This problem motivates us to create a food delivery service that not only delivers meals to your doorstep but also ensures that they are prepared by professional chefs.
<br><br>


<Strong>Appetite: </Strong>

Our appetite for this project is to develop and launch the service within a 6-week cycle, specifically targeting a quick time-to-market approach. This constraint will force us to focus on essential features and avoid overcomplicating the solution. We want to prioritize speed and simplicity to deliver a minimum viable product.
<br><br>
<Strong>Solution: </Strong>
<br>
Our solution is to create a food delivery service with a network of professional chefs who prepare meals either in a central kitchen or from their own homes. This approach ensures that the food is of the highest quality, with a variety of culinary options. Customers can order meals through a user-friendly app, and our delivery system will bring the chef-prepared meals to their doorstep.

Here is the feature some details about the feature that I am working on.
<br><br>

<Strong>Food Recommendation Feature: </Strong>
<br>
One of the key features that I am working on is a food recommendation system. This feature will use customer preferences, likes, and interactions to suggest personalized food options. For example, if a customer frequently orders Italian dishes or interacts with Italian food content on the app, the recommendation system will show videos and suggestions for Italian cuisine. This feature aims to enhance the customer experience, encourage exploration of different cuisines, and drive user engagement.
<Strong>Rabbit Holes: </Strong>
<br>
One potential rabbit hole to watch out for is the complexity of the recommendation algorithm. We need to strike a balance between providing personalized suggestions and not overloading the user with options. Additionally, we must ensure that the recommendation system respects privacy and doesn't cross ethical boundaries by collecting too much user data.
<br><br>
<Strong>No-Gos: </Strong>
<br>
One no-go for this concept is to avoid becoming a traditional restaurant platform. We won't allow any food establishment without a certified professional chef to join our network. Additionally, we won't offer WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing of the menu for chefs. This decision aligns with our appetite for simplicity and the quick development cycle. We'll focus on curated chef-prepared meals rather than customization.
