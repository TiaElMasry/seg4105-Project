1. Project Overview
* Description: Developing an algorithm for personalized video recommendations in our food app.
* Current Phase: Implementation of core functionalities and database interaction.
2. Accomplishments
* Initial Recommendations: Implemented feature to request initial recommendations from the backend for the user's feed upon app launch.
* Video Playback Tracking: The app now automatically plays videos and sends asynchronous requests to the backend to record start of video playback.
* New or Reset Users : For new users, it plays the trending videos available if no preference or watch history or when watch history is reset, default recommendations (e.g., trending or most-watched videos) will be used before personalized data collection begins.
* 
3. Next Steps
* Interaction Recording: Implemented functionality to capture user interactions with videos (likes, shares, comments) and whether the video was watched completely or partially.
* Database Interaction: Integrate PostgreSQL and WordPress for backend data management.
* Docker Deployment: Prepare for pushing the project to Docker Hub and subsequent deployment.
* WordPress: Using Wordpress to create Plugins that will help with the data management and also gives a view of the products available. 
4. Key Considerations
* New or Reset Users: For new users or when watch history is reset, default recommendations (e.g., trending or most-watched videos) will be used before personalized data collection begins.
* Asynchronous Recommendation Updates: Ensure recommendations are updated asynchronously based on user interactions and watch history.
* Importance of Watch Duration: Incorporate video watch duration as a significant factor in refining recommendations.
* Multiple Watched Categories: Develop a strategy to prioritize video categories in recommendations based on frequency, total watch time, and user interactions (likes, comments, shares).
